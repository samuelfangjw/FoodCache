FoodCache is a Food Management App that helps reduce food wastage by keeping track of expiring ingredients, suggest recipes for meals to minimize food waste and act as a platform to share excess food and ingredients with friends and family. 

FoodCache is a project by team Breakfast Set A (Jarveis and Samuel) for CP2106 (Orbital), a summer-long self-directed, independent work course. The project acheived the Apollo 11 (Advanced) level of achievement.
